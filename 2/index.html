    <p id="ammoniation">A solution of common salt is prepared with 28% of NaCl, to which we call as brine. Brine is led to an ammoniating
        tower where it mixes with NH<sub>3</sub> gas until saturated ammoniated brine is obtained.<br />
        Before ammoniation, brine should be free from traces of MgCl<sub>2</sub> and CaCl<sub>2</sub>. This can be done by 
        adding caustic soda which procipitates these impurities as Mg(OH)<sub>2</sub> and Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub>.
